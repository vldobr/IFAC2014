the paper type might have been altered to fit the
conference program. The preliminary program for the
conference will be available by March 3, 2014 at the
Congress website www.ifac2014.org. Note that the final
programme may be different to the preliminary programme.
Please note that the paper type might have been altered to
fit the conference program.

Please note that reviewers' comments and the associate
editor's summary are attached herewith, and can also be
accessed by logging into your account and following the
link for reviews for this contribution at:

http://ifac.papercept.net/

It is important that any critical comment therein is
adequately addressed before the final paper is submitted.

Note the following VERY IMPORTANT issues when submitting
your final manuscript:

1. PDF Quality - accepted papers will be archived on the
IFAC-PapersOnLine system (except for papers accepted on the
basis of extended abstracts). ALL papers must comply with
the following quality requirements:=20

a. Searchable (you can test this by using the search
function of Acrobat reader)

b. Must have all fonts embedded and subsetted.

You will not be able to upload your files without meeting
the two criteria above. We relaxed these requirements for
the initial submission, but they will be strictly enforced
for the final submission. Please test your PDF file using

http://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/pdftest.pl

2. Reference List - in order to make your manuscripts more
widely referenced, along with the PDF file, you are also
required to upload references from your manuscripts as a
text file. References can be copied and pasted from your
searchable PDF file into a plain text file and uploaded
into the system as a part of your final submission process.

3. Copyright Form - as a step in your paper upload process,
you will be required to electronically transfer the
copyright of your manuscript to the IFAC. You do not need
to submit a separate copyright form.

4. Registration Fee and Paper Upload - Congress
participation is conditioned to the payment of the
registration fee. As for the paper upload, the widely
advertised congress policy requires that at least one of
the authors of a manuscript must have paid the registration
fee for the final upload. Detailed registration
requirements are explained at: www.ifac2014.org.

Any of the co-authors of a paper may register to upload the
paper, however, only the corresponding author is able to
upload the final paper.=20

In addition, please note that all papers have a page limit
of 6 pages (12 pages for survey or keynote papers).
Additional pages are charged at =80100 per page, up to a
maximum of 3 extra pages.

----

Electronic submission of the final version of your
manuscript is due by 31 March 2014 through the Conference
Manuscript Management System (CMMS). The final submission
process also requires that you update the abstract and make
any final changes to the author list and title before
uploading. Please note that any names of authors not
updated on the submission site will not be included in the
final program of the congress.

Electronic submission for final contributions is scheduled
to open on 14 February 2014. The basic instructions
regarding registration and preparation of the final version
of your contribution will be available at www.ifac2014.org.

Please also consult this website for further updates about
the conference.

Congratulations on this fine achievement! We are looking
forward to seeing you in Cape Town in August 2014.

Yours sincerely,

Edward Boje, IPC Co-Chair Xiaohua Xia, IPC Co-Chair

19th IFAC World Congress

Reviewer 2 of IFAC WC 2014 submission 2048

Comments to the author
======================

The paper is written well but needs figures that will be
readable in print form.  In most cases some of the details
are not large enough to make out.  Some terminology should
be clarified for the reader, such as sink polar.

The paper assembles various techniques and data that could
be used to evaluate collaboration between multiple sail
planes in soaring.  Most of the techniques are existing in
the literature, such as the Kalman filtering of the data,
the nature of the thermal convection, and the capabilities
of the batteries.  It appears that batteries are actually
tested with solar panels in a stationary experiment.  The
remainder of the work is in simulation using a simulation
package called Condor.	The behavior of the aircraft and
the environment it encounters are provided by Condor, which
is a well tested and accepted to represent these entities
reasonably.  Some matters are not explained, such as what
is electric power doing.  Is it powering the glider some
time or is it only running the electronics?  The necessity
of combining the photovoltaic and the convective energy
sources is touted but the interaction between the two is
not explained, if there is interaction at all.

Some of the references given are dated, such as the
reference on electronics packaging, dated 1995.  The last
20 years has produced many changes.

Unfortunately the conclusions are not presented as to the
feasibility of indefinite flight, apparently because the
work has not completed to that extent.	As the authors
state at the beginning, the paper is a review but also
presents some new ways of using the reviewed items.

Reviewer 3 of IFAC WC 2014 submission 2048

Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents the initial development of convective
thermal and solar energy harvesting capability integrated
onboard  of  multiple  cooperative  gliders.
The  discussion details the key technologies required to
integrate the energy harvesting into a cooperative mission
planning and execution environment.

The paper reads well and is interesting, but has some
drawbacks that should be corrected to make it more readable

A) it is too long and details too many aspects of the
overall system making it confused : the electric energy
management subsystem (sec. 2.1) can be omitted or
considerably shortened since I think these details are not
necessary in a conference paper
B) Some parts of sec. 2.1 are rather obscure for readers
that do not have a knowledge of the glider dynamics and
guidance; e.g., what is the sink rate polar? Along the same
lines, the results presented in Fig. 5 shall be better
explained
C) Section 3 is titled “Cooperative algorithms” but it
mainly describes the Bayesian mapping of the thermals; the
cooperative algorithm is very simple ... all the glider go
where the updraft has been detected; so I suggest to
shorten this section
D) The simulation environment, on the contrary, gives a
very concise presentation of the resulta; this section
should be enlarged.

One minor comment: the authors refer the figures in the
text as “Figure.n”, where n is the figure number. Please
omit the dot and put a space in its place.

Reviewer 8 of IFAC WC 2014 submission 2048

Comments to the author
======================

The paper proposes a multiple cooperative glider system
which utilises convective thermal and solar energy
harvesting.   It discusses the key technologies which is
required to integrate the energy harvesting into a
cooperative mission planning and execution environment.  
The discussed key technologies includes the characteristics
of the electrical (PV solar and batteries) management
system, detection of convective thermal center, and the
collaborative sensing.

The results of the section 2.1 (the characteristics of the
electrical PV solar and battery system) are easily
predictable.   It merely confirm these properties by the
experiments.

The updraft detection in the section 2.2 and the guidance
control to thermal center in the section 2.3 are
interesting, but not new.

The cooperative algorithm which searches the thermal center
with multiple glider (main result) is new and useful, but
the approach is conventional.

Comments to the author
======================

The work reported in the paper is quite cutting edge
however it appears that the work is still in its early
stages thus the paper does not provide concrete results. I
do think however that the paper will be greatly improved if
it provided more literature review as a survey of existing
methods so as to give context to the approach which is
proposed
