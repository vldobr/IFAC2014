The paper presents the multidisciplinary systematic approach to the the design of a fleet of cooperative gliders capable of extended endurance operation. The flock of autonomous gliders is able to harvest energy from the environment both through photo-voltaic energy generation and through exploitation of natural convective lift in the surrounded air, and acts cooperatively to meet mission requirements and to share knowledge of the local environment. The paper begins with a brief overview of the total-energy approach required for such a feat, along with a short description of key system components. This is followed by details of the evolution of a previously-developed architecture that supported autonomous thermaling, to an architecture that considers the total-energy budget in all flight segments, and optimizes the cooperative flight to maximize the  cumulative energy capture while simultaneously meeting the mission objectives.

\section{Introduction}
Imagine a large team of gracefully soaring autonomous gliders instrumented with sensors capable of detecting and utilizing the convective air flow, and high-efficiency solar panels which are seamlessly embedded into the wings to replenish the electrical energy of onboard batteries that power avionics. The gliders are sequentially launched from a distant area and assigned to provide, for example, an extended communication network coverage or to serve as a low-orbit observation satellites for the forest fire or border protection. The gliders reach the area of operations and remain there unattended for an extended period of time, perhaps up to a year. When a need for maintenance arises the distributed intelligent algorithm then reconfigures the team of gliders and dispatches a subset of aircraft for the scheduled service; in turn, when a substitute or serviced aircraft return the same algorithm reconfigures the team to accept the new players. The distributed soaring gliders can either operate in a distributed fashion or fly together in a suitable formation to provide a more focused high-resolution support. The latter may include cooperative distributed sensing to achieve the desired sensors resolution, tracking of weather formations, border patrol, etc. that are currently provided by much larger, heavier and more expensive systems.

Despite significant advances in a number of technologies resulting in shrinking the size, weight and power (SWAP) constraints in aerospace technologies, the ability to stay aloft for extended periods of time is still remain reserved for larger systems such as AWACS and/or mid and large scale UAVs such as Predators and Global Hawks. While extremely capable either of these systems still do not provide the desired $24/7$ continuous operational endurance and flexibility. Deployment of these assets requires large teams of ground personnel and has to be planned with significant and sufficient lead-time. Needless to say that the development and operational cost of those assets might be prohibitively expensive.

What if the endurance capabilities of larger aircraft and UAVs were achieved by much smaller autonomous systems with significantly less power consumption and maintenance needs? Then these smaller and cheaper UAVs would be able to carry out many missions reserved today for larger, heavier, more expensive long endurance systems. This is the precisely the objective, that has been addressed in the recent development by~\cite{AKlass_JGCD:2012,AKlass_CDC:2012}. The project concept shifts the paradigm from large, costly single point of failure platforms to distributed, small unmanned systems that can provide the same level of service at a significantly lower cost and with greater robustness. To achieve the goal, the project develops a system of multiple cooperating autonomous gliders that harvest thermal (convective air) and solar energy (photovoltaic) to achieve distributed collaborative sensing and dynamic area coverage according to a specific task at a significantly lower operational cost and personnel requirements (training and manning) than the existing systems.


\subsection{Technical Background and Envisioned Approach}

One of the most critical limiting factors impacting effective collaborative autonomy today is the lack of endurance that is typical in most of the existing autonomous aircraft. Numerous futuristic ideas and concepts will not be implemented in real life solely due to this single reason. Until $R\&D$ community realizes that the energy onboard (of either a single or a flock of agents) and the mission objectives are equally important metrics of the mission management (planning and execution), and finds a way of solving this challenge, there will not be revolutionary advances made in the area of persistent intelligent collaborative autonomy.

Despite almost two decades of significant advances in low-power and high-performance microelectronics development including CPUs, sensors, actuators, and communication circuits~\cite{Tong:1995},\cite{Singh:2010}, the only task addressed was to lower the power consumption of autonomous machines and therefore to reduce the pace of energy expenditures. On the other hand, the progress of energy renewable technologies is lagging behind. Since the loss of energy is unavoidable due to the inefficiency in energy conversion, storage, and transmission, the mission duration will always be limited. However, implementing novel approaches for the cooperative mission design and execution along with the optimal energy management can not only further reduce the rate of loss of limited energy resources but also can result in energy increase during the autonomous mission execution; this capability is not readily available today in any of the available technologies, see~\cite{Siciliano:2008},\cite{Martinez:2008},and \cite{Nonami:2013}.

Despite the complexity of the energy-management task, the practical solutions of the extended duration flight do exist in nature. Millions of years of evolution enable a number of families of birds for very long duration flights. While the fundamentals of flight are the same, the effective energy management principles during the flight do differ. One of the most extraordinary birds capable of the long duration flight is the bar-tailed godwit, a large, streamlined shorebird, that performs a non-stop across the ocean flight, see\cite{USGS:2007}, of more than eight days over a distance of 7,200 miles; the distance equivalent of making a round-trip flight between New York and Paris without ever touching down. Another example is the albatross that can fly around the world with little or no flapping of their wings, see~\cite{Richardson:2011}. Remarkably, some birds can remain aloft for years at a time; the swift, for example, spends nearly its entire life in the air while landing only to breed. Along with many other animals (for example dolphins, whales), swifts evolved to be able to put one side of their brain to sleep at a time, so that they can sleep in the air while not actually being unconscious, see~\cite{Lapierre:2007}. What is common among these examples is not only the evolved capability of the high efficiency flight, but also the unique ability to manage energy that is implemented by both the optimal energy expenditures and energy harvesting.

Considering the current state of the art in aerial robotics (algorithmic support, instrumentation, SWAP constraints), it is our firm belief that the best approach to enable long duration flight would combine the collaborative mission management and energy harvesting. Collaboration is the first key capability that spans across every element of the mission. First, collaboration enables effective search of available energy. Most of the available energy sources are not visible but detectable by intelligent robots equipped with appropriate sensors. Thus, multiple agents would have much better chances of finding ''free energy`` when cooperating and sharing their findings. Second, the operational utility of multiple agents equipped with complementary sensors is superior to the capability of an individual agent. Finally, robustness of the collaborative mission execution is significantly higher because partial loss of a subset of the vehicles does not lead to the loss of entire flock capability. Energy harvesting is the second complementary enabler of long endurance flight that enables accumulation of energy. The methods of energy extraction feasible for aerial application include the solar photovoltaic and airflow soaring that can be based on the convective air (thermaling) or wind shear energy extraction. While the photovoltaic boost can be achieved only during the daylight, the extraction of power of surrounded moving airflow can be utilized even during the nighttime. This combination is the ultimate solution for the "eternal`` operational endurance.

Therefore, it is envisioned that enhancing mission performance while reducing its cost can be achieved by implementing energy harvesting and collaboration capabilities onboard of multiple autonomous solar-powered and thermal-soaring gliders. Thus, the triplet of (\emph{\textbf{i}}) mission management, (\emph{\textbf{ii}}) energy harvesting and (\emph{\textbf{iii}}) collaboration builds the fundamental architecture of future energy enhanced autonomy.  This architecture should be based on the distributed online execution of the following individual and distributed platforms' algorithms:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.35cm]
%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Individual glider:
 \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.25cm]
 \item Integration of prior knowledge of the operational environment into effective collaborative search for energy;
 \item Identification of the inherent flying qualities of each glider and detection of the environmental energy excess (convective thermal or wind shear) which are based on the total mechanical energy (the sum of kinetic and potential energy);
 \item Identification of parameterized mathematical models of energy sources and estimation and ''mapping`` of their dynamic motion;
 \item Autonomous guidance to enable energy harvesting while in the vicinity of an energy source;
 \item Optimization of solar energy gain and electrical energy storage while in thermal soaring flight; 
 \item Sharing of the environment knowledge and the current state of cumulative energy (stored in onboard batteries plus the total mechanical energy) of each glider;
 \end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%
\item Flock of gliders:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.25cm]
  \item Distributed mission planning and cooperative control of the flock as functions of mission objectives and the reported cumulative energy of the flock; local feedback to the mission planner allows for timely update and adjustment;
  \item Estimation of the free energy density distribution in the operational environment;
  \item Adjustment of the scale of the mission (number and strategy of multiple agents) defined by the rate of total energy expenditure.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Since the number of involved algorithms and technologies is significant, the remainder of the paper briefly outlines the core ideas implemented to date in both the high-fidelity simulation and the real onboard hardware environments. Therefore, Section \ref{sec:InAlgs} describes the ''individual gliders`` algorithms as outline above. The following section \ref{sec:CoopAlgs}  outlines the development of the collaborative autonomy algorithms. Section \ref{sec:SysIntegration} provides necessary details of the system integration including the environment for verification and validation of the developed algorithms in high-fidelity simulation and experimental flight testing. The paper ends with a brief outline of the future development steps.

\section{Individual Gliders Algorithms}
\label{sec:InAlgs}

The algorithms of individual platforms enable identification of the inherent flight dynamics properties of the glider which are in turn used to detect the thermal updrafts. When flying in the updraft the guidance algorithm is engaged to enable the maximum harvesting of the updraft energy, and on the other hand allows for the estimation of the updraft geometry and the motion that are used to map the updraft and share its utility properties across the network of collaborative gliders. While in autonomous soaring mode, the electrical management system that consists of solar panels, batteries and the maximum energy tracking circuitry, supports the avionics and optimally recharges the batteries. At any given time each individual platform can be either in a search mode or in a soaring mode. While the soaring mode is directly defined by the energy gain objective, the search mode is driven by the intelligent algorithm that combines the goals of the distributed mission and the need to search for energy sources in the environment.

\subsection{System identification and Updraft Detection}
\label{sec:SysID}

There is a number of prior efforts devoted addressing the auto-soaring capability. While enabling the desired functionality to some extent most of the algorithms implement significant heuristic in the identification of the updraft strength and the potential utility of the updraft to the specific glider at hand. While adapting the conceptual ideas, the approach used implements the algorithms of online estimation of uncertain flight dynamics of the glider and the parameterized model of the convective updraft.

\label{sec:Future}

Next we see a few subsections.

\subsection{Review Stage}

{\bf Please use this document as a “template” to prepare your manuscript. For submission guidelines, follow instructions on paper submission system as well as the Conference website.}

Note that conferences impose strict page limits, so it will be better for you to prepare your initial submission in the camera ready layout so that you will have a good estimate for the paper length. Additionally, the effort required for final submission will be minimal.

Some words might be appropriate describing equation~(\ref{e1}), if
we had but time and space enough.
\begin{equation} \label{e1}
{{\partial F}\over {\partial t}} =
D{{\partial^2 F}\over {\partial x^2}}.
\end{equation}
See \cite{Abl:56}, \cite{AbTaRu:54}, \cite{Keo:58} and \cite{Pow:85}.

\subsubsection{A subsubsection}This equation goes far beyond the celebrated theorem ascribed to the great Pythagoras by his followers.
\begin{thm}
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares
of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{thm}
\begin{pf}
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares
of the lengths of the other two sides.
\end{pf}

\subsection{Final Stage}

Authors are expected to mind the margins diligently. Conference papers need to be stamped with conference data and paginated for inclusion in the proceedings. If your manuscript bleeds into margins, you will be required to resubmit and delay the proceedings preparation in the process.

\subsection{Page margins}

All dimensions are in {\it centimeters}.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Margin settings} \\
\hline
Page & Top & Bottom & Left/Right \\ \hline
First & 3.5 & 2.5 & 1.5 \\ \hline
Rest & 2.5 & 2.5 & 1.5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

It is very important to maintain these margins. They are necessary to put conference information and page number for the proceedings.


\subsection{Figures and PDF Creation}

All figures must be embedded in the document. When you include the image, make sure to insert the actual image rather than a link to your local computer.. As far as possible, use standard PDF conversion tools Adobe Acrobat or Ghostscript give best results. {\bf It is important that all  fonts be embedded/subsetted in the resulting PDF}.

\subsection{Copyright Form}

IFAC will put in place an electronic copyright transfer system in due course. Please “do not” send copyright forms by mail or FAX. More information on this will be made available on IFAC website.

\section{Math}

If you are using Word, use either the Microsoft Equation
Editor or the MathType add-on for equations in your paper (Insert | Object | Create New | Microsoft Equation or MathType Equation). “Float over text” should not be selected. Of course LaTeX manages equations through built-in macros.

\section{Units}

Use either SI as primary units. Other units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). This applies to papers in data storage. For example, write “$15 Gb/cm^2$ ($100 Gb/in^2$).” An exception is when English units are used as identifiers in trade, such as “3.5 in disk drive.” Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity in an equation.
The SI unit for magnetic field strength H is A/m. However, if you wish to use units of $T$, either refer to magnetic flux density $B$ or magnetic field strength symbolized as $\mu_0 H$. Use the center dot to separate compound units, e.g., “$A\cdot m^2$.”

\section{Helpful Hints}

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than symbols. As an example, write the quantity “Magnetization,” or “Magnetization M,” not just “M.” Put units in parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. As in Fig. 1, for example, write “Magnetization (A/m)” or “Magnetization (A m?1),” not just “A/m.” Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write “Temperature (K),” not “Temperature/K.”

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write “Magnetization (kA/m)” or “Magnetization (103 A/m).” Do not write “Magnetization (A/m) ? 1000” because the reader would not know whether the top axis label in Fig. 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be legible, approximately 8 to 12 point type.

\subsection{References}

Use Harvard style references (see at the end of this document). If you are using LaTeX, you can process an external bibliography database or insert it directly into the reference section. Footnotes should be avoided as far as possible.
Please note that the references at the end of this document are in the preferred referencing style. Papers that have not been published should be cited as “unpublished.” Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}

Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have already been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IFAC, SI, ac, and dc do not have to be defined. Abbreviations that incorporate periods should not have spaces: write “C.N.R.S.,” not “C. N. R. S.” Do not use abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable (for example, “IFAC” in the title of this article).

\subsection{Equations}

Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush with the right margin, as in (1). First use the equation editor to create the equation. Then select the “Equation” markup style. Press the tab key and write the equation number in parentheses. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate equations when they are part of a sentence, as in

\begin{equation} \label{e2}
\begin{array}{ll}
\int_0^{r_2} & F (r, \varphi ) dr d\varphi = [\sigma r_2 / (2 \mu_0 )] \\
& \cdot \int_0^{\inf} exp(-\lambda |z_j - z_i |) \lambda^{-1} J_1 (\lambda  r_2 ) J_0 (\lambda r_i ) d\lambda
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the equation appears or immediately following. Italicize symbols (T might refer to temperature, but T is the unit tesla). Refer to “(1),” not “Eq. (1)” or “equation (1),” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (1) is ... .”

\subsection{Other Recommendations}

Use one space after periods and colons. Hyphenate complex modifiers: “zero-field-cooled magnetization.” Avoid dangling participles, such as, “Using (1), the potential was calculated.” [It is not clear who or what used (1).] Write instead, “The potential was calculated by using (1),” or “Using (1), we calculated the potential.”

A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.) Avoid contractions; for example, write “do not” instead of “don’t.” The serial comma is preferred: “A, B, and C” instead of “A, B and C.”


\section{Conclusion}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
