The results are not convincing enough please improve your
paper the details see in the reviews.

======================

The paper is written well but needs figures that will be
readable in print form.  In most cases some of the details
are not large enough to make out.  Some terminology should
be clarified for the reader, such as sink polar.

The paper assembles various techniques and data that could
be used to evaluate collaboration between multiple sail
planes in soaring.  Most of the techniques are existing in
the literature, such as the Kalman filtering of the data,
the nature of the thermal convection, and the capabilities
of the batteries.  It appears that batteries are actually
tested with solar panels in a stationary experiment.  The
remainder of the work is in simulation using a simulation
package called Condor.	The behavior of the aircraft and
the environment it encounters are provided by Condor, which
is a well tested and accepted to represent these entities
reasonably.  Some matters are not explained, such as what
is electric power doing.  Is it powering the glider some
time or is it only running the electronics?  The necessity
of combining the photovoltaic and the convective energy
sources is touted but the interaction between the two is
not explained, if there is interaction at all.

Some of the references given are dated, such as the
reference on electronics packaging, dated 1995.  The last
20 years has produced many changes.

Unfortunately the conclusions are not presented as to the
feasibility of indefinite flight, apparently because the
work has not completed to that extent.	As the authors
state at the beginning, the paper is a review but also
presents some new ways of using the reviewed items.

The paper presents the initial development of convective
thermal and solar energy harvesting capability integrated
onboard  of  multiple  cooperative  gliders.
The  discussion details the key technologies required to
integrate the energy harvesting into a cooperative mission
planning and execution environment.

The paper reads well and is interesting, but has some
drawbacks that should be corrected to make it more readable

A) it is too long and details too many aspects of the
overall system making it confused : the electric energy
management subsystem (sec. 2.1) can be omitted or
considerably shortened since I think these details are not
necessary in a conference paper
B) Some parts of sec. 2.1 are rather obscure for readers
that do not have a knowledge of the glider dynamics and
guidance; e.g., what is the sink rate polar? Along the same
lines, the results presented in Fig. 5 shall be better
explained
C) Section 3 is titled “Cooperative algorithms” but it
mainly describes the Bayesian mapping of the thermals; the
cooperative algorithm is very simple ... all the glider go
where the updraft has been detected; so I suggest to
shorten this section
D) The simulation environment, on the contrary, gives a
very concise presentation of the resulta; this section
should be enlarged.

One minor comment: the authors refer the figures in the
text as “Figure.n”, where n is the figure number. Please
omit the dot and put a space in its place.

The paper proposes a multiple cooperative glider system
which utilises convective thermal and solar energy
harvesting.   It discusses the key technologies which is
required to integrate the energy harvesting into a
cooperative mission planning and execution environment.  
The discussed key technologies includes the characteristics
of the electrical (PV solar and batteries) management
system, detection of convective thermal center, and the
collaborative sensing.

The results of the section 2.1 (the characteristics of the
electrical PV solar and battery system) are easily
predictable.   It merely confirm these properties by the
experiments.

The updraft detection in the section 2.2 and the guidance
control to thermal center in the section 2.3 are
interesting, but not new.

The cooperative algorithm which searches the thermal center
with multiple glider (main result) is new and useful, but
the approach is conventional.

======================

The work reported in the paper is quite cutting edge
however it appears that the work is still in its early
stages thus the paper does not provide concrete results. I
do think however that the paper will be greatly improved if
it provided more literature review as a survey of existing
methods so as to give context to the approach which is
proposed
